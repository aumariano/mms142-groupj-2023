        <h2>DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY</h2>
            <p>
            In a groundbreaking journal article penned by Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen and fellow academicians, disruptive technology was described as an <strong>innovation that empowers entities with fewer resources to successfully challenge established businesses.</strong>
            Disruption occurs when industry entrants effectively target segments that were overlooked by incumbents and mainstream customers adopt in volume the entrants’ offerings designed with more suitable functionality. (Christensen et. al., 2015).
            According to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professional Education, disruptive technology refers to “innovative inventions or evolved current technology that changes the way society behaves, thinks, or interacts. It also changes the way businesses or industries operate.” (Diego.Geraldo, 2023).
            Disruptive innovation is vital in <strong>promoting healthy competition, driving progress, and realizing new solutions</strong> that effectively address the mercurial changes in customer needs, habits and preferences. (FDieffenbacher, 2023).
            </p>

        <h2>EXAMPLES OF DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY</h2>
        <p>An MIT article (Diego. Geraldo, 2023) hails the following as some of the most promising examples of disruptive technology poised to change the world:</p>

        <h1>E-COMMERCE AS A DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY</h1>
        <p>
            Looking back at the storied evolution of commerce -- from the straight barter trade system, street hawking, sidewalk peddling, house-to-house marketing, charming mom-and-pop stores, all the way to the era of imposing brick-and-mortar superstores -- the advent and subsequent explosion of e-Commerce could only be termed as indeed disruptive.
            Early e-Commerce naysayers and doomsayers would be astounded to learn that this innovation had ballooned into a 5.2 trillion U.S. dollar global industry by 2021 and a market of 2.64 billion online buyers worldwide by 2023. (Cramer-Flood, 2022).
        </p>

        <h2>WHAT IS E-COMMERCE?</h2>
        <p>
            Electronic commerce, more known as e-commerce, is the buying and selling of products and services online with the use of the Internet. Its operation includes the exchange of data or currency, and the use of systems and tools to enable the process of transaction. In the modern world, just about everything can be sold and bought online including various home appliances, movies, or music. Financial services are also available online, including stock investments and online banking. Because of its wide scope in various industries, e-commerce falls under the category of being a disruptive technology.
        </p>

        <h2>TYPES OF E-COMMERCE</h2>
        <p>
            In e-commerce, the general idea of an e-commerce operation is between a supplier and a client. While true enough, there are six common types of e-commerce used to distinguish each situation into a specific classification.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Business-to-Consumer (B2C)</strong>: Direct selling of goods and services from a business to the end consumer.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Business-to-Business (B2B)</strong>: Companies selling goods and services to other companies, often involving larger quantities and specifications.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Business-to-Government (B2G)</strong>: Companies specializing in providing goods and services to government agencies.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C)</strong>: Online third-party platforms facilitating trades and transactions between consumers.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Consumer-to-Business (C2B)</strong>: Consumers providing goods and services to companies, including freelancers and individuals.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Consumer-to-Government (C2G)</strong>: Transactions between individuals and government agencies, often involving obligations like tax payments and tuition fees.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="before_ecommerce">

        <h1>THE WORLD BEFORE E-COMMERCE</h1>

        <p>Back then, people were used to exchanging goods to obtain their needs, which is called bartering (Shopney, 2022). Then, they started using cattle as a form of currency (Fryer, n.d.). Afterward, they exchanged valuable objects and shells (Fryer, n.d.). Later on, coins were made and used as currency (Shopney, 2022). Subsequently, The Silk Road happened, the reason why people learn from each other’s cultures and religions (Shopney, 2022). Then, markets arose where buyers and sellers could exchange products and services (Fryer, n.d.). After a while, paper currency was developed, which was easier to carry than coins (Shopney, 2022). Next, the age of discovery happened when Europeans began to discover more about the world by using sea roads and uncovering new lands (Shopney, 2022). What followed was the birth of the gold standard system, where a nation’s currency has a cost correlated to gold (Shopney, 2022). Later on, credit cards arose, which can be utilized to buy products and services that can be paid for later (Shopney, 2022). Lastly, Electronic Data Interchange happened. It is a method of trading pieces of information and was said to be the foundation of E-Commerce since it paved the way for transferring information digitally (Shopney, 2022).</p>
        <p>
            According to Aldrich (2010), the costs of transportation were increasing, while the opposite goes for the costs of Telecom. In this case, it would be more practical, effortless, and convenient to remain in our homes and buy online. In fact, Michael Aldrich, the father of e-commerce, has experienced difficulty in going to the market to buy such things (IWD, 2023). Thus, this is the reason why they decided to make the shopping transaction program, which has now evolved into online shopping, and plays an enormous part in e-commerce (Aldrich, 2010).
            Michael Aldrich thought of the inconvenience of having to go to a mall to shop for items you are looking for. His first thought was how convenient it would be if people were able to shop using their television sets and a landline.
            Developed in an office in the Crawley Industrial Stat in early 1979, Michael, along with his other colleagues, took a couple of months developing the then called “Teleshopping”. In September 1979, Michael presented their work in a convention in New Orleans. The goal was to gain feedback from the people. The feedback was positive with the audience loving the great idea of being able to shop at home. In April 1980, Michael released their product to the public; and again in July of the same year. However, the modern way of e-commerce rooted at the launch of Boston Computer Exchange in 1982.
            The goal of online commerce was to create convenience for consumers to buy products without the need to go to a mall. At the early stages of e-commerce, e-commerce did not disrupt practices and technology. With the early methods relying on television sets and phone lines, e-commerce was not as profitable. It was not until the invention of the internet did e-commerce have a great impact. In present time, e-commerce continues to disrupt the retail industry through the continued development of AI technology.
            E-commerce brought convenience to the general consumers. With the continued improvements done to e-commerce, people saw its potential and the demand for it increased. Big companies had to adapt to this new technology and with the help of the internet, e-commerce became a global phenomenon.</p>

        <h2>THE E-COMMERCE WAVE</h2>
        <p>
            The concept of e-commerce started way back in the 1960s. Before the Internet, companies would use the Electronic Data Interchange or the EDI. It is an electronic system that is used to facilitate the transfer of documents. In the late 1960s, specifically 1969, in Columbus, Ohio, two electrical engineering students launched CompuServe, which became the first-ever commercial online service in the United States.
            In 1979, an English inventor named Michael Aldrich created the very first secure data transmission using a transaction-processing computer and a doctored television. This laid the groundwork for online shopping.
            Although the Boston Computer Exchange, which was the first online marketplace, emerged in 1982, the very first online transaction did not occur until the 1990s. In 1994, the first online transaction was on a website called NetMarket. By 1995, more influential e-commerce marketplaces were launched. This included Amazon and eBay. By 1997, both of these companies completed one million transactions online. 1998 saw the emergence of personal and business-related financial transactions with the debut of PayPal, an e-commerce payment system.
            Since then, the world of e-commerce has gone through a series of developments. In 2000, Google launched Google AdWords. Google AdWords allows e-commerce businesses to advertise themselves through the Google search engine.
            In the mid to late 2000s, the use of service memberships and e-wallets became more popular over time. The Amazon Prime membership was introduced in 2005. In 2009 saw the launch of Square, a platform for financial services. Their service allows the acceptance of debit and credit payments through an app. In 2014, Apple launched Apple Pay, a mobile payment service.
            Because of the many technological advancements throughout the history of e-commerce, many other businesses and companies have needed to adapt and embrace the new technological changes in order to keep up and stay competitive with other businesses in the market.
            Of course, e-commerce does not only affect big companies. With the new technology in the modern world, many people have now adapted with online buying and selling. E-commerce has become more popular because of its convenience. The ordinary consumer can connect with businesses by simply visiting a website or downloading an app in order to make transactions.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="e-commerce_today">
        <h1>E-Commerce Today</h1>
        <h2>The Market Today</h2>
        <p>
            With the rapid increase in information and rich technological developments that improve the quality of life, consumer behavior has become equally as fast-paced. It has been shifting from market to market (e.g. in-store to online), constantly exploring the latest innovations that would put consumers’ convenience at the forefront and change consumer preferences.
            E-commerce being an expansive and accessible alternative to in-store shopping, consumers and businesses alike have been migrating to this option – a fact magnified during the COVID-19 pandemic. The world had come to a stop:  industries had to cease operations, and people were forced to stay indoors to avoid contracting and spreading the virus. To adapt, businesses had to take their goods and services to online platforms to reach their customers (and even possibly grow their following). Although many businesses had to cut their losses and worse, close permanently, there was a spike of 8% in total global retail e-commerce sales from 2019 to 2020 – and a forecasted steady rise through 2024. Global consumers contributed to a 44% increase in digital purchases from their favorite websites and a 47% increase in digital purchases from online marketplaces. (International Trade Administration, n.d.)
            In response to these observations, different tech companies integrated e-commerce technologies into their apps, even unconventional ones. Case in point: TikTok Shop. Given the migration of small and big businesses to TikTok for better promotion of their products, the app has been developing itself as a social commerce platform. With no third party mediating in the purchase process, TikTok gets to help more businesses. (Payne, 2023)
            Given the cross-border nature of e-commerce, a myriad of options have been made available to the regular consumer, which in turn, modified consumers’ preferences. According to research conducted by Brandwatch (2023), there has been a rise in off-brand-product and dupe (or “duplicate”/cheaper alternative) purchases. Not to say that people turn to these because they want to; in fact, most people don’t have a choice due to inflation (but that’s a different conversation for a different time.). The cross-border nature of e-commerce provides consumers with the opportunity to access cheaper off-brand goods from different distributors that source them from the actual warehouses. (Brandwatch, 2023)
        </p>
        <h2>Strengths</h2>
            <p>E-commerce, although utilized by consumers even before the COVID-19 pandemic, has proven itself to be a solid commerce alternative throughout the years. Despite having some vulnerabilities as all internet-reliant technologies do, it seems like e-commerce’s strengths outweigh these in the long run as the pace of life seems to quicken. Some of these strengths include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Providing a strong and sustainable alternative way of purchasing:</strong>This is evident in how it withstood the almost two-year pandemic. If it was able to withstand the market uncertainties during that period, then it proves itself to be a reliable enough alternative that we can carry with us to the future.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Its effortless purchase process and provision of a user-centric shopping experience:</strong>E-commerce allows consumers to shop at their own pace. They can add items to their carts without having to checkout on the same day, more so at the same hour. It leaves room for consumers’ responsible discernment. To check out an item, a few taps & verifications on their gadget are all it takes to make the item theirs; now all they have to do is wait for it to arrive right at their doorstep.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Prioritizing cashless transactions: and</strong>Although cash-on-delivery is an available payment method, e-commerce champions cashless transactions.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Providing easier access to goods and services from the local and international markets:</strong>Through its cross-border nature, e-commerce makes the purchase of local and international goods seamless. In effect, it provides an avenue for local and international small businesses to promote and export their goods to different countries.</li>
            </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Vulnerabilities</h3>

        <p>Vulnerabilities in systems, networks, or processes can be most pronounced at various stages, but they are often at their weakest when security measures are lax or insufficiently implemented. Here are some key points:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Weaknesses in Security Measures:</strong> Vulnerabilities are most evident when security measures, such as encryption protocols, firewalls, or access controls, are not adequately applied or regularly updated. This can leave systems open to exploitation by cybercriminals.</li>
            <li><strong>Human Error or Lack of Awareness:</strong> Vulnerabilities can also surface due to human error, such as falling for phishing scams, clicking on suspicious links, or using weak passwords. When individuals within an organization are not adequately trained in cybersecurity best practices, they become potential weak points.</li>
            <li><strong>Outdated Software and Systems:</strong> Legacy systems or outdated software that no longer receive security updates are often more vulnerable to exploitation by cyber attackers. These vulnerabilities may remain unaddressed due to a lack of resources or negligence in updating systems.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            E-commerce brings forth numerous drawbacks, notably security risks that endanger consumer data, exemplified by instances compromising financial information due to breaches. The absence of face-to-face interaction contributes further as it can lead to delays in addressing queries, potentially causing dissatisfaction. Moreover, logistical challenges like delivery delays or damaged goods contribute to customer discontent. Consumers shoulder the primary burden of e-commerce vulnerabilities, facing threats such as security breaches and identity theft. Small businesses, particularly smaller online retailers, grapple with competition against larger corporations, struggling due to resource limitations in implementing robust security measures. Additionally, citizens in developing countries, especially those with limited secure internet access or lacking digital literacy, face pronounced challenges in e-commerce, including heightened security risks and the absence of personal interaction. In the Philippines, hurdles encompass limited access to secure internet infrastructure, digital literacy gaps, and socioeconomic disparities hindering communities' full participation in the digital economy. Addressing these issues necessitates global efforts, emphasizing enhanced cybersecurity, improved digital literacy, and equitable technology access, crucial for fostering a secure and inclusive digital environment.
        </p>

    </div>

    <div class="conclusion">
        <h1>Improvements</h1>
        <p>
            As E-Commerce continues to boom with the ever growing number of online buyers there are a lot of improvements that can be done to further improve the experience and security of both sellers and customers.
        </p>

        <h1>Here are a few suggestions for each platform:</h1>

        <h2> Lazada and Shopee </h2>
        <p>
            Lazada and Shopee are two of the largest online shopping platforms in the Philippines and there are a lot of occurrences of misleading listings and defective products (Monzon & Aning, 2023).<br> 
            Aside from that, in Singapore, another country where the e-commerce giants are also present, the platforms had trouble in processing refunds and other related consumer complaints (Ming, 2023). <br> 
            Users have also reported non-informative reviews of the products from other users which contributes to the confusion in buying items from the online shopping platforms. <br>
        </p>
        <h3>The following issues could be resolved by these following recommendations:</h3>
            <li>Much more thorough seller verification</li>
            <li>Legitimacy of items being delivered</li>
            <li>Review Quality Inspection (Ensure that users thoroughly reviewed their item correctly)</li>
            <li>Improvement in the refund process</li>
            <li>Prevention of scams (Edited damaged items)</li> 


        <h2>Live Selling (Lazada, Shopee, FB, Tiktok)</h2>
        <p>
            Another feature of the e-commerce giants in the country is live online selling. According to CNN Philippines (2023), it has the potential to lead online retail in the Asia Pacific region and also across the globe.<br>  
            However, a known issue is the so-called ‘joy-miners’ who pretend to show interest to purchase the item by commenting the word ‘mine’ and will later cancel the transaction which leads to delays and disruptions.<br>  
            A good measure is to have a ‘ban-hammer’ which bans users with repeated offenses to prevent them from being a nuisance to the sellers and other buyers. It is already an existing concept in video games. (Serin, 2023)
        </p>

        <h2>BNS (Twitter / X and FB Marketplace)</h2>
        <p>
            Even before the onset of the digital revolution, buy and sell (BNS) was already an existing practice among entrepreneurs which are very prone to scams. <br> 
            Now that the practice has moved to the digital space, it still faces the same problems as before. Facebook Marketplace, is one of the well-known buy and sell platforms in the country.<br>  
            It has little to no requirements before being able to buy or sell which resulted in a lot of dummy accounts used in scamming.<br>  
            Facebook should place preventive measures such as ID verification to prevent scammers from using the platform as it requires them to present a legal proof of identity.   
        </p>  

        <h2>TikTok Shop (UGC)</h2>
        <p>
            User Generated Content (UGC) is one of the rising practices in e-commerce as it portrays authenticity to the customers as it makes them feel that they are talking to a person and not a company (Piga, 2022).<br>   
            Tiktok has now integrated a shopping platform directly on the short form contents via the Tiktop shop or the yellow basket. <br>  
            However, it can still be sometimes misleading or deceptive as the product the users use may be different from what they’ve seen in the video. <br>  
            The platform should include measures such as item testing and verification that would discourage sellers and content creators from selling such items. 
        </p>
    
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>
            The e-commerce industry brought a lot of positive impact in various fronts.Logistics have significantly improved due to the needs of this industry. <br>
            Users are now able to receive their items within a short period of time. The prices of products in online shopping platforms are typically cheaper due to the reduced operational costs such as limited staff and lower utility bills. <br>
            This industry also created new jobs such as delivery drivers, riders, and online sellers (Manila Bulletin Business, 2023). However, there are still a lot of mishaps that need to be bridged. <br>
            A common issue in the different facets of the industry is scamming and deceptive marketing. The platforms should place added security measures such as stricter profiling for both users and sellers alike. <br>
            In that way, both sides would have additional protection from being a victim of fraud. </p><br>
