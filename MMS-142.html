<h1> What is E-Commerce?</h1>

<p> Electronic commerce, more known as e-commerce, is the buying and selling of products and services online with the use of the Internet. Its operation includes the exchange of data or currency, and the use of systems and tools to enable the process of transaction. In the modern world, just about everything can be sold and bought online including various home appliances, movies, or music. Financial services are also available online, including stock investments and online banking. Because of its wide scope in various industries, e-commerce falls under the category of being a disruptive technology.
</p>

<h2> Types of E-Commerce </h2>

<p> In e-commerce, the general idea of an e-commerce operation is between a supplier and a client. While true enough, there are six common types of e-commerce used to distinguish each situation into a specific classification.</p>

<h3> 1.   Business-to-Consumer (B2C) </h3>

<p> This is the most common business model. It refers to the direct selling of goods and services of a business to the consumer who will ultimately use the product they have purchased.  </p>

<h3> 2.   Business-to-Business (B2B) </h3>

<p> This business model is similar to the B2C model type. However, instead of a company selling to a consumer, they are instead selling to another company. This process usually involves purchase of larger quantities, greater specifications, and longer lead times.  </p>


<h3> 3.   Business-to-Government (B2G) </h3>

<p> This business model involves companies that are specialized in providing goods and services to government agencies.</p>


<h3> 4.   Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) </h3>

<p> With the rise of online shopping, various third parties and digital marketplaces exist in the online space for consumers to perform trades and transactions with other consumers.</p>

<h3> 5.   Consumer-to-Business (C2B) </h3>

<p> This business model refers to the consumer being a provider of goods and services for companies. This includes freelancers and individuals performing trades and transactions to big companies independently and autonomously.</p>


<h3> 6.   Consumer-to-Government (C2G) </h3>

<p> Similar to the C2B model, consumer-to-government refers to the transaction between individuals and government agencies. This often involves transaction of obligation rather than the exchange of goods and services. Examples include payment of taxes and tuition fees.</p>


<!- TheE-Commerce Wave->

<h1> The E-Commerce Wave </h1>

<p> The concept of e-commerce started way back in the 1960s. Before the Internet, companies would use the Electronic Data Interchange or the EDI. It is an electronic system that is used to facilitate the transfer of documents. In the late 1960s, specifically 1969, in Columbus, Ohio, two electrical engineering students launched CompuServe, which became the first-ever commercial online service in the United States. </p>

<p> In 1979, an English inventor named Michael Aldrich created the very first secure data transmission using a transaction-processing computer and a doctored television. This laid the groundwork for online shopping.</p>

<p> Although the Boston Computer Exchange, which was the first online marketplace, emerged in 1982, the very first online transaction did not occur until the 1990s. In 1994, the first online transaction was on a website called NetMarket. By 1995, more influential e-commerce marketplaces were launched. This included Amazon and eBay. By 1997, both of these companies completed one million transactions online. 1998 saw the emergence of personal and business-related financial transactions with the debut of PayPal, an e-commerce payment system. </p>

<p> Since then, the world of e-commerce has gone through a series of developments. In 2000, Google launched Google AdWords. Google AdWords allows e-commerce businesses to advertise themselves through the Google search engine. </p>

<p> In the mid to late 2000s, the use of service memberships and e-wallets became more popular over time. The Amazon Prime membership was introduced in 2005. In 2009 saw the launch of Square, a platform for financial services. Their service allows the acceptance of debit and credit payments through an app. In 2014, Apple launched Apple Pay, a mobile payment service. </p>

<p> Because of the many technological advancements throughout the history of e-commerce, many other businesses and companies have needed to adapt and embrace the new technological changes in order to keep up and stay competitive with other businesses in the market. </p> 

<p> Of course, e-commerce does not only affect big companies. With the new technology in the modern world, many people have now adapted with online buying and selling. E-commerce has become more popular because of its convenience. The ordinary consumer can connect with businesses by simply visiting a website or downloading an app in order to make transactions. </p>
