<h1>The Potential of E-Commerce</h1>
<h2>Improvements</h2>

<p>As E-Commerce continues to boom with the ever growing number of online buyers there are a lot of improvements that can be done to further improve the experience and security of both sellers and customers.<br>

<h1>Here are a few suggestions for each platform:</h1>

</p>

<h2> Lazada and Shopee </h2>
<p>Lazada and Shopee are two of the largest online shopping platforms in the Philippines and there are a lot of occurrences of misleading listings and defective products (Monzon & Aning, 2023).<br> 
Aside from that, in Singapore, another country where the e-commerce giants are also present, the platforms had trouble in processing refunds and other related consumer complaints (Ming, 2023). <br> 
Users have also reported non-informative reviews of the products from other users which contributes to the confusion in buying items from the online shopping platforms. <br>

<h3>The following issues could be resolved by these following recommendations:</h3>
<li>Much more thorough seller verification</li>
<li>Legitimacy of items being delivered</li>
<li>Review Quality Inspection (Ensure that users thoroughly reviewed their item correctly)</li>
<li>Improvement in the refund process</li>
<li>Prevention of scams (Edited damaged items)</li> 

</p>

<h2>Live Selling (Lazada, Shopee, FB, Tiktok)</h2>
<p>Another feature of the e-commerce giants in the country is live online selling. According to CNN Philippines (2023), it has the potential to lead online retail in the Asia Pacific region and also across the globe.<br>  
However, a known issue is the so-called ‘joy-miners’ who pretend to show interest to purchase the item by commenting the word ‘mine’ and will later cancel the transaction which leads to delays and disruptions.<br>  
A good measure is to have a ‘ban-hammer’ which bans users with repeated offenses to prevent them from being a nuisance to the sellers and other buyers. It is already an existing concept in video games. (Serin, 2023)
</p>

<h2>BNS (Twitter / X and FB Marketplace)</h2>
<p>Even before the onset of the digital revolution, buy and sell (BNS) was already an existing practice among entrepreneurs which are very prone to scams. <br> 
Now that the practice has moved to the digital space, it still faces the same problems as before. Facebook Marketplace, is one of the well-known buy and sell platforms in the country.<br>  
It has little to no requirements before being able to buy or sell which resulted in a lot of dummy accounts used in scamming.<br>  
Facebook should place preventive measures such as ID verification to prevent scammers from using the platform as it requires them to present a legal proof of identity.   
</p>  

<h2>TikTok Shop (UGC)</h2>
<p>User Generated Content (UGC) is one of the rising practices in e-commerce as it portrays authenticity to the customers as it makes them feel that they are talking to a person and not a company (Piga, 2022).<br>   
Tiktok has now integrated a shopping platform directly on the short form contents via the Tiktop shop or the yellow basket. <br>  
However, it can still be sometimes misleading or deceptive as the product the users use may be different from what they’ve seen in the video. <br>  
The platform should include measures such as item testing and verification that would discourage sellers and content creators from selling such items. 
</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>The e-commerce industry brought a lot of positive impact in various fronts.Logistics have significantly improved due to the needs of this industry. <br>
Users are now able to receive their items within a short period of time. The prices of products in online shopping platforms are typically cheaper due to the reduced operational costs such as limited staff and lower utility bills. <br>
This industry also created new jobs such as delivery drivers, riders, and online sellers (Manila Bulletin Business, 2023). However, there are still a lot of mishaps that need to be bridged. <br>
A common issue in the different facets of the industry is scamming and deceptive marketing. The platforms should place added security measures such as stricter profiling for both users and sellers alike. <br>
In that way, both sides would have additional protection from being a victim of fraud. <br>
