    <h1>DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY</h1>
    <h2>E-Commerce</h2>

    <h2>WHAT IS DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY?</h2>
    <p>In a groundbreaking journal article penned by Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen and fellow academicians, disruptive technology was described as an innovation that empowers entities with fewer resources to successfully challenge established businesses.</p>
    <p>Disruption occurs when industry entrants effectively target segments that were overlooked by incumbents and mainstream customers adopt in volume the entrants’ offerings designed with more suitable functionality. (Christensen et. al., 2015).</p>
    <p>According to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professional Education, disruptive technology refers to “innovative inventions or evolved current technology that changes the way society behaves, thinks, or interacts. It also changes the way businesses or industries operate.” (Diego.Geraldo, 2023).</p>
    <p>Disruptive innovation is vital in promoting healthy competition, driving progress, and realizing new solutions that effectively address the mercurial changes in customer needs, habits and preferences. (FDieffenbacher, 2023).</p>

    <h2>EXAMPLES OF DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY</h2>
    <p>An MIT article (Diego. Geraldo, 2023) hails the following as some of the most promising examples of disruptive technology poised to change the world:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Blockchain</li>
        <li>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</li>
        <li>The Cloud</li>
        <li>Internet Of Things</li>
        <li>Cybersecurity</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A Harvard Business School Online post has identified the following industries as being “on the cusp of significant change.”</p>
    <ul>
        <li>3D Printing in Manufacturing</li>
        <li>The iBuyer Model in Real Estate</li>
        <li>eSports in the Sports Industry</li>
    </ul>
<br>

 <h2>E-COMMERCE AS A DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY</h2>
    <p>Looking back at the storied evolution of commerce -- from the straight barter trade system, street hawking, sidewalk peddling, house-to-house marketing, charming mom-and-pop stores, all the way to the era of imposing brick-and-mortar superstores -- the advent and subsequent explosion of e-Commerce could only be termed as indeed disruptive.</p>
    <p>Early e-Commerce naysayers and doomsayers would be astounded to learn that this innovation had ballooned into a 5.2 trillion U.S. dollar global industry by 2021 and a market of 2.64 billion online buyers worldwide by 2023. (Cramer-Flood, 2022).</p>

    <h2>WHAT IS E-COMMERCE?</h2>
    <p>Electronic commerce, more known as e-commerce, is the buying and selling of products and services online with the use of the Internet. Its operation includes the exchange of data or currency, and the use of systems and tools to enable the process of transaction. In the modern world, just about everything can be sold and bought online including various home appliances, movies, or music. Financial services are also available online, including stock investments and online banking. Because of its wide scope in various industries, e-commerce falls under the category of being a disruptive technology.</p>

    <h2>TYPES OF E-COMMERCE</h2>
    <p>In e-commerce, the general idea of an e-commerce operation is between a supplier and a client. While true enough, there are six common types of e-commerce used to distinguish each situation into a specific classification.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Business-to-Consumer (B2C)</strong>: Direct selling of goods and services from a business to the end consumer.</li>
        <li><strong>Business-to-Business (B2B)</strong>: Companies selling goods and services to other companies, often involving larger quantities and specifications.</li>
        <li><strong>Business-to-Government (B2G)</strong>: Companies specializing in providing goods and services to government agencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C)</strong>: Online third-party platforms facilitating trades and transactions between consumers.</li>
        <li><strong>Consumer-to-Business (C2B)</strong>: Consumers providing goods and services to companies, including freelancers and individuals.</li>
        <li><strong>Consumer-to-Government (C2G)</strong>: Transactions between individuals and government agencies, often involving obligations like tax payments and tuition fees.</li>
    </ol>
<br>

<h2>THE WORLD BEFORE E-COMMERCE</h2>

    <h3>A. The commerce landscape before e-commerce came about.</h3>
    <p>Back then, people were used to exchanging goods to obtain their needs, which is called bartering (Shopney, 2022). Then, they started using cattle as a form of currency (Fryer, n.d.). Afterward, they exchanged valuable objects and shells (Fryer, n.d.). Later on, coins were made and used as currency (Shopney, 2022). Subsequently, The Silk Road happened, the reason why people learn from each other’s cultures and religions (Shopney, 2022). Then, markets arose where buyers and sellers could exchange products and services (Fryer, n.d.). After a while, paper currency was developed, which was easier to carry than coins (Shopney, 2022). Next, the age of discovery happened when Europeans began to discover more about the world by using sea roads and uncovering new lands (Shopney, 2022). What followed was the birth of the gold standard system, where a nation’s currency has a cost correlated to gold (Shopney, 2022). Later on, credit cards arose, which can be utilized to buy products and services that can be paid for later (Shopney, 2022). Lastly, Electronic Data Interchange happened. It is a method of trading pieces of information and was said to be the foundation of E-Commerce since it paved the way for transferring information digitally (Shopney, 2022).</p>

    <h3>B. Socio-economic context then</h3>
    <p>According to Aldrich (2010), the costs of transportation were increasing, while the opposite goes for the costs of Telecom. In this case, it would be more practical, effortless, and convenient to remain in our homes and buy online. In fact, Michael Aldrich, the father of e-commerce, has experienced difficulty in going to the market to buy such things (IWD, 2023). Thus, this is the reason why they decided to make the shopping transaction program, which has now evolved into online shopping, and plays an enormous part in e-commerce (Aldrich, 2010).</p>
    <p>Michael Aldrich thought of the inconvenience of having to go to a mall to shop for items you are looking for. His first thought was how convenient it would be if people were able to shop using their television sets and a landline.</p>
    <p>Developed in an office in the Crawley Industrial Stat in early 1979, Michael, along with his other colleagues, took a couple of months developing the then called “Teleshopping”. In September 1979, Michael presented their work in a convention in New Orleans. The goal was to gain feedback from the people. The feedback was positive with the audience loving the great idea of being able to shop at home. In April 1980, Michael released their product to the public; and again in July of the same year. However, the modern way of e-commerce rooted at the launch of Boston Computer Exchange in 1982.</p>
    <p>The goal of online commerce was to create convenience for consumers to buy products without the need to go to a mall. At the early stages of e-commerce, e-commerce did not disrupt practices and technology. With the early methods relying on television sets and phone lines, e-commerce was not as profitable. It was not until the invention of the internet did e-commerce have a great impact. In present time, e-commerce continues to disrupt the retail industry through the continued development of AI technology.</p>
    <p>E-commerce brought convenience to the general consumers. With the continued improvements done to e-commerce, people saw its potential and the demand for it increased. Big companies had to adapt to this new technology and with the help of the internet, e-commerce became a global phenomenon.</p>

    <h2>THE E-COMMERCE WAVE</h2>
    <p>The concept of e-commerce started way back in the 1960s. Before the Internet, companies would use the Electronic Data Interchange or the EDI. It is an electronic system that is used to facilitate the transfer of documents. In the late 1960s, specifically 1969, in Columbus, Ohio, two electrical engineering students launched CompuServe, which became the first-ever commercial online service in the United States.</p>
    <p>In 1979, an English inventor named Michael Aldrich created the very first secure data transmission using a transaction-processing computer and a doctored television. This laid the groundwork for online shopping.</p>
    <p>Although the Boston Computer Exchange, which was the first online marketplace, emerged in 1982, the very first online transaction did not occur until the 1990s. In 1994, the first online transaction was on a website called NetMarket. By 1995, more influential e-commerce marketplaces were launched. This included Amazon and eBay. By 1997, both of these companies completed one million transactions online. 1998 saw the emergence of personal and business-related financial transactions with the debut of PayPal, an e-commerce payment system.</p>
    <p>Since then, the world of e-commerce has gone through a series of developments. In 2000, Google launched Google AdWords. Google AdWords allows e-commerce businesses to advertise themselves through the Google search engine.</p>
    <p>In the mid to late 2000s, the use of service memberships and e-wallets became more popular over time. The Amazon Prime membership was introduced in 2005. In 2009 saw the launch of Square, a platform for financial services. Their service allows the acceptance of debit and credit payments through an app. In 2014, Apple launched Apple Pay, a mobile payment service.</p>
    <p>Because of the many technological advancements throughout the history of e-commerce, many other businesses and companies have needed to adapt and embrace the new technological changes in order to keep up and stay competitive with other businesses in the market.</p>
    <p>Of course, e-commerce does not only affect big companies. With the new technology in the modern world, many people have now adapted with online buying and selling. E-commerce has become more popular because of its convenience. The ordinary consumer can connect with businesses by simply visiting a website or downloading an app in order to make transactions.</p>
