<h1>The World Before E-Commerce</h1>
<h2>Describe the commerce landscape before e-commerce came about.</h2>
<p>Back then, people were used to exchanging goods to obtain their needs, which is called bartering (Shopney, 2022). Then, they started using cattle as a form of currency (Fryer, n.d.). Afterward, they exchange valuable objects and shells (Fryer, n.d.). Later on, coins were made and used as a currency (Shopney, 2022). Subsequently, The Silk Road happened, the reason why people learn from each other’s cultures and religions (Shopney, 2022). Then, markets arose where buyers and sellers could exchange products and services (Fryer, n.d.). After a while, paper currency was developed, which was easier to carry than coins (Shopney, 2022). Next, the age of discovery happened when Europeans began to discover more about the world by using sea roads and uncovering new lands (Shopney, 2022). What followed was the birth of the gold standard system, where a nation’s currency has a cost correlated to gold (Shopney, 2022). Later on, credit cards arose, which can be utilized to buy products and services that can be paid for later (Shopney, 2022). Lastly, Electronic Data Interchange happened. It is a method of trading pieces of information and was said to be the foundation of E-Commerce since it paved the way for transferring information digitally (Shopney, 2022).</p>
<h2>Socio-economic context then</h2>
<p>According to Aldrich (2010), the costs of transportation were increasing, while the opposite goes for the costs of Telecom. In this case, it would be more practical, effortless, and convenient to remain in our homes and buy online. In fact, Michael Aldrich, the father of e-commerce, has experienced difficulty in going to the market to buy such things (IWD, 2023). Thus, this is the reason why they decided to make the shopping transaction program, which has now evolved into online shopping, and plays an enormous part in e-commerce (Aldrich, 2010).</p>
