<h1>The World Before E-Commerce</h1>
<h2>A.  The commerce landscape before e-commerce came about.</h2>

<p>Back then, people were used to exchanging goods to obtain their needs, which is called bartering (Shopney, 2022).<br>
Then, they started using cattle as a form of currency (Fryer, n.d.). Afterward, they exchange valuable objects and<br>
shells (Fryer, n.d.). Later on, coins were made and used as a currency (Shopney, 2022). Subsequently, The Silk Road<br>
happened, the reason why people learn from each other’s cultures and religions (Shopney, 2022). Then, markets arose<br>
where buyers and sellers could exchange products and services (Fryer, n.d.). After a while, paper currency was<br>
developed, which was easier to carry than coins (Shopney, 2022). Next, the age of discovery happened when Europeans<br>
began to discover more about the world by using sea roads and uncovering new lands (Shopney, 2022). What followed<br>
was the birth of the gold standard system, where a nation’s currency has a cost correlated to gold (Shopney, 2022).<br>
Later on, credit cards arose, which can be utilized to buy products and services that can be paid for later<br>
(Shopney, 2022). Lastly, Electronic Data Interchange happened. It is a method of trading pieces of information and<br>
was said to be the foundation of E-Commerce since it paved the way for transferring information digitally (Shopney, 2022).<br>

<h2>B.  Socio-economic context then.</h2>
<p>According to Aldrich (2010), the costs of transportation were increasing, while the opposite goes for the costs<br>
of Telecom. In this case, it would be more practical, effortless, and convenient to remain in our homes and buy<br>
online.In fact, Michael Aldrich, the father of e-commerce, has experienced difficulty in going to the market to<br>
buy such things (IWD, 2023). Thus, this is the reason why they decided to make the shopping transaction program,<br>
which has now evolved into online shopping, and plays an enormous part in e-commerce (Aldrich, 2010). Michael Aldrich<br>
thought of the inconvenience of having to go to a mall to shop for items you are looking for. His first thought was<br>
how convenient it would be if people were able to shop using their television sets and a landline. Developed in an<br>
office in the Crawley Industrial Stat in early 1979, Michael, along with his other colleagues, took a couple of months<br>
developing the then called “Teleshopping”. In September 1979, Michael presented their work in a convention in New<br>
Orleans. The goal was to gain feedback from the people. The feedback was positive with the audience loving the great<br>
idea of being able to shop at home. In April 1980, Michael released their product to the public; and again in July of<br>
the same year. However, the modern way of e-commerce rooted at the launch of Boston Computer Exchange in 1982.<br>

<h1>The Goal</h1>
<p>The goal of online commerce was to create convenience for consumers to buy products without the need to go to a<br>
mall. At the early stages of e-commerce, e-commerce did not disrupt practices and technology. With the early methods<br>
relying on television sets and phone lines, e-commerce was not as profitable. It was not until the invention of the<br>
internet did e-commerce have a great impact. In present time, e-commerce continues to disrupt the retail industry<br>
through the continued development of AI technology.E-commerce brought convenience to the general consumers. With the<br>
continued improvements done to e-commerce, people saw its potential and the demand for it increased. Big companies<br>
had to adapt to this new technology and with the help of the internet, e-commerce became a global phenomenon.<br>
